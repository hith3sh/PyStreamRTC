Welcome to PyStreamRTC, versatile media streaming solution leveraging the power of Python, GStreamer, and WebRTC. 

## 🛠 Installation and Setup Instructions

### Install GStreamer and other libraries

I have only checked the workflow for debian based systems. Feel free to check the workflow in any other platform, but below libraries won't be easy to install in others
#### For Debian platforms
`sudo apt-get install -y gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly libnice-dev gstreamer1.0-nice libglib2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev pkg-config python3-dev python3-gst-1.0 libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-good1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gobject-introspection`

#### Then pip install these
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Navigate to the location and start streaming 🚀
`cd PyStreamRTC`

`python streamer.py --video /path/to/your/video.mp4`
```
> Starting pipeline
======== Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 ========
